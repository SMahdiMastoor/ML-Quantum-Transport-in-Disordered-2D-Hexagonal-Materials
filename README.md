# ML-Quantum-Transport-in-Disordered-2D-Hexagonal-Materials

## ðŸ“– Abstract: 
We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key
quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and the local
density of states (LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with
magnetic disorder. Using a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-
Equilibrium Greenâ€™s Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset
of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and
stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations and en-
ergy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometry-
driven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to gen-
eralize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and
classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability and extrapo-
lation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing of
continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation per-
formance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models
in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of
scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future re-
search into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved
generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.
